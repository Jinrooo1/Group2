      <h2>I. Summary of Stream</h2>

<p>The streamers started off with a simple and concise introduction, giving our
  names and a brief description of our identities. After the brief introduction,
  the streamers moved on to the topic of the stream immediately, starting with
  questions that revolved around the chosen topic, that being “How gaming can affect
  depression."  The questions are as follows: </p>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>What do you guys think depression does to someone physically?</li>
    <li>Loneliness is one of the main causes of depression, how do you think this can be fixed?</li>
    <li>Do you guys think there are any other ways to cure depression other than therapy?</li>
    <li>This is a very controversial topic but if a severely depressed person who's
      been suffering their whole lives wanted to die would you let them free themselves
      from life or prevent them from doing so?</li>
    <li>How much do you think depression affects society?</li>
    <li>Games can help relieve stress and negative emotions but is it
      true that some games can also inspire violence and rude behavior?</li>
    <li>People say games are actually responsible for depression as well, what do you think about it?</li>
    <li>People say the internet and media are main causes for the sudden increase of
      cases of depression, what do you think about this? Do you think it’s true or false?</li>
    <li>Different video game genres affect the players emotions accordingly,
      which genre do you think can help cure depression the best?</li>
  </ul>
<p>All the group members participated and helped with the discussion, they gave
  their honest and thorough answers, opinions, and ideas regarding the topic and even
  helped to expand the discussion by adding more unto the discussion, in the middle of
  the stream at a specific mark the streamers had a 5-minute break to give the members
   some time to breathe and go to the bathroom if needed, not only did the streamers answer
   the questions the streamers prepared before the stream the streamers also discussed what
    depression and games are by giving brief descriptions
 </p>
<br>
<p>Once the streamers ran out of questions and no longer had anything to discuss,
  the streamers bid the viewers goodbye, though of course before doing so the streamers
  made sure to promote our channel  reminded the viewers to like and subscribe, and thanked
  them for staying until the very end of the stream which lasted for about 50 minutes and 33 seconds.
 </p>
<br>
<p>66.67% of our respondents agreed that the streamers have nothing to improve on.
  As much as the streamers love that feedback, the streamers know deep in themselves
  that the streamers need to improve some aspects of their stream, such as starting our
  stream, our audio, our cam, and the flow of the stream.

      <h2>II. Success during the stream</h2>
<p>Good audio, background music, and stream design are key elements in establishing
  a satisfying streaming experience. For the purpose of producing a satisfying listening
  experience, good audio quality is crucial. Setting the mood and creating an environment
  for the stream can be done with background music. Moreover, stream design is crucial for
  providing viewers with a visually appealing experience.

</p>
<br>
<p>The audio the streamers produced, in our opinion, is the best the streamers
  could have done with the materials that were available to us. By doing this,
   viewers are certain to comprehend what the streamers are saying. The ability to
    clearly hear the streamer's replies and comments is another advantage of a decent
    microphone for a podcast session.
</p>
<p>The streamers also believe that the streamers made good use of the background
  music the streamers chose because, after the stream, one of our classmates inquired
  about it and stated that it was quite appropriate for the topic. Moreover, background
  music can be employed to set a calm mood for a lighthearted stream or an upbeat one for a
  competitive game.
</p>
<br>

<p>40% of the respondents answered 5/5 in a 1-5 question regarding how new the information is to them, whereas 26.6% answered 4/5 of the information is new to them. 56.7% of the respondents answered that the information given in the stream can be used immediately. 90% of the respondents answered yes as to whether or not they wanted to learn more about the topic. 80% of the respondents answered that the streamers’ knowledge of the topic is excellent. 83.3% of the respondents agreed that the topic was relevant to their lives. 63.3% of the respondents rated the streamer’s ability to engage them in content as excellent. 76.6% of our respondents think the stream design is excellent. 56.6% of our respondents think our stream time is excellent. 73.3% of our respondents think our platform venue is excellent. 50% of our respondents think our stream outline’s accuracy is excellent. 56.6% of our respondents think our streaming session met their expectations. 66.6% answered that our overall stream session was excellent.

    <h2>III. Issues with our Stream</h2>
<p>Even though the streamers manage to stream our content on social media, there
  are a few things that they need to improve on. Based on our survey, 10% of our
  viewers mentioned that the streamers had some technical issues starting their streams.
  With this feedback, we plan to have at least a 5 min timer before the streamers start
   the stream so that they can prepare properly while our stream is running.
</p>
<br>
<p>The second thing the streamers noticed in our stream is that our audience we’re
   not participating in chatting with us, even though the streamers have comment
   sections the streamers didn’t get a response when the streamers asked them
   “Which video game genre do you think can help cure depression the best?”, With this problem,
   the streamers plan to do a giveaway that might interest our audience and maybe this will encourage
   them to participate in our stream.
 </p>
</div>
 </div>

 </div>
 <div class="container" data-aos="fade-up">

   <div class="section-title">
     <h2>IV. Level of Engagement</h2>
 <p>If the streamers are asked on a scale of 1-10 how engaging our stream was,
   the streamers will answer 8 since they were able to keep our conversation
   going without much dead air. You may ask why the streamers did not give themselves a
   10, that's because the streamers know in themselves that they still have a lot of
   room to improve. Yes,  our stream was successful, but it doesn't mean that perfect,
   the streamers can still improve with the help of the feedback that our audience gave
   through a Google Form.

 </p>
 <br>
 <p>One of our problems is our audience engagement, they did not really participate in
   our comment section. So in our next stream, the streamers plan to have at least a PHP100
   giveaway since the absence of an incentive is another aspect that may hinder audience involvement.
   Viewers could not understand the value of participating in the stream if there were no observable
   benefits, like awards or exclusive access. Streamers ought to think about adding rewards and incentives
   that motivate viewers to participate in the discussion.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Overall, it is alarming that so little of our audience is participating in their broadcast.
    Yet, with the appropriate kind of involvement, the use of incentives, and the creation of captivating content,
     the streamers may successfully boost audience participation and make their viewers' viewing experience more interactive.

  <h2>V. Results</h2>
<p>Based on the analytics of our YouTube channel and Facebook page, the streamers
  can say that our views are on the high side. Their stream accumulated an average
  of about 40 views on YouTube, while on Facebook, the streamers got exceptional views
  of around 120+ views. The reasons the streamers can account for our high views are the
  remarkable effort that their group put into the promotional materials and outstanding
  promotion that made people more aware of our stream, which in turn raised the numbers of viewers.

</p>
<br>
<p>According to our survey to determine the demographics our audience, out of the 30
  people who responded 70%(21) are between 11-17 years old and the last 30%(9) is split
  from 18-64 years old.  66.67% of respondents rated our overall stream session is excellent,
  30% rated it very good lastly 3.33% rated it good.
