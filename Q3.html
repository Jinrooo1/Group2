      <h2>I. Summary of Stream</h2>

<p>The streamers started off with a simple and concise introduction, giving their
  names and a brief description of their identities. After the brief introduction,
  the streamers moved on to the topic of the stream immediately, starting with questions
  that revolved around the chosen topic, that being “How gaming can affect depression."
  The questions are as follows: </p>
  <br>
  <p>[1]What do you guys think depression does to someone physically?; [2]Loneliness
    is one of the main causes of depression, how do you think this can be fixed?; [3]Do you
    guys think there are any other ways to cure depression other than therapy?; [4]This is a very
    controversial topic but if a severely depressed person who's been suffering their whole life wanted
    to die would you let them free themselves from life or prevent them from doing so?; [5]How much do you
    think depression affects society?; [6]Games can help relieve stress and negative emotions but is it true
    that some games can also inspire violence and rude behavior?; [7]People say games are actually responsible
    for depression as well, what do you think about it?; [8]People say the internet and media are main causes for
    the sudden increase of cases of depression, what do you think about this? Do you think it’s true or false?;
    [9]Different video game genres affect the players emotions accordingly, which genre do you think can help cure
    depression the best?
</p>
<br>
<p>All the group members participated and helped with the discussion, they gave their
  honest and thorough answers, opinions, and ideas regarding the topic and even helped to expand the discussion
  by adding more to the discussion, in the middle of the stream at a specific mark the streamers had a 5-minute
  break to give the members some time to breathe and go to the bathroom if needed, not only did the streamers answer
   the questions the streamers prepared. Before the stream, the streamers also discussed what depression and games are
   by giving brief descriptions. </p>
<br>
<p>Once the streamers ran out of questions and no longer had anything to discuss,
  they bid the viewers goodbye, though of course before doing so they made sure to promote their channel,
   reminded the viewers to like and subscribe, and thanked them for staying until the very end of the stream,
   which lasted for about 50 minutes and 33 seconds. </p>

 </p>
<br>
<p>66.67% of their respondents agreed that the streamers have nothing to improve on.
  As much as the streamers love that feedback, the streamers know deep in themselves that
  the streamers need to improve some aspects of their stream, such as starting their stream,
  their audio, their cam, and the flow of the stream.

      <h2>II. Success during the stream</h2>
<p>Good audio, background music, and stream design are key elements in establishing
  a satisfying streaming experience. For the purpose of producing a satisfying listening
  experience, good audio quality is crucial. Setting the mood and creating an environment
  for the stream can be done with background music. Moreover, stream design is crucial for
  providing viewers with a visually appealing experience.

</p>
<br>
<p>The audio the streamers produced, in their opinion, is the best the streamers
  could have done with the materials that were available to them. By doing this,
  viewers are certain to comprehend what the streamers are saying. The ability to
  clearly hear the streamer's replies and comments is another advantage of a decent
  microphone for a podcast session.
</p>
<br>
<div data-aos="fade-up">
<p>The streamers also believe that they made good use of the background music they chose
  because, after the stream, one of our classmates inquired about it and stated that it
  was quite appropriate for the topic. Moreover, background music can be employed to set a
  calm mood for a lighthearted stream or an upbeat one for a competitive game.

    <h2>III. Issues with our Stream</h2>
<p>Even though the streamers manage to stream their content on social media,
  there are a few things that they need to improve on. Based on their survey,
  10% of their viewers mentioned that the streamers had some technical issues
  starting their streams. With this feedback, they plan to have at least a 5 min
  timer before the streamers start the stream so that they can prepare properly
  while their stream is running. </p>
<br>
<p>The second thing the streamers noticed in their stream is that their audience
  are not participating in chatting with them, even though the streamers have comment
  sections the streamers didn’t get a response when the streamers asked them “Which video
  game genre do you think can help cure depression the best?”, With this problem, the streamers
  plan to do a giveaway that might interest their audience, and maybe this will encourage them to
  participate in their stream.

 </p>
</div>
 </div>

 </div>
 <div class="container" data-aos="fade-up">

   <div class="section-title">
     <h2>IV. Level of Engagement</h2>
 <p>One of their problems is their audience engagement, the audience did not really
   participate in their comment section. So in their next stream, the streamers
   plan to have at least a PHP100 giveaway since the absence of an incentive is another
   aspect that may hinder audience involvement. Viewers could not understand the value of
   participating in the stream if there were no observable benefits, like awards or exclusive access.
    Streamers ought to think about adding rewards and incentives that motivate viewers to participate in the
    discussion. With that being said their energy was amazing and capped the lack of engagement of the viewers.
 </p>
 <br>

  <p>Overall, it is alarming that so little of our audience is participating in their broadcast.
    Yet, with the appropriate kind of involvement, the use of incentives, and the creation of captivating content,
     the streamers may successfully boost audience participation and make their viewers' viewing experience more interactive.
</p>

  <h2>V. Results</h2>
<p>Based on the analytics of their YouTube channel and Facebook page, the
  streamers can say that their views are on the high side. Their stream accumulated
  an average of about 40 views on YouTube, while on Facebook, the streamers got exceptional
  views of around 120+ views. The reasons the streamers can account for their high views are the
  remarkable effort that their group put into the promotional materials and outstanding promotion
  that made people more aware of their stream, which in turn raised the numbers of viewers.
</p>
<br>
<p>According to their survey to determine the demographics of their audience,
  out of the 30 people who responded 70%(21) is between 11-17 years old and the last 30%(9)
  are split from 18-64 years old.  66.67% of respondents rated their overall stream session as
  excellent, 30% rated it very good lastly 3.33% rated it good.

  <h2>VI. Appendix</h2>
 <!-- ======= Appendix  ======= -->

 <p>This part of the stream analysis paper is called the “Appendix” this section
   highlights the responses given in the stream feedback form with the use of graphs,
   numerical values and pie graphs to emphasize the different answers given by each and
   every one of the respondents that answered the form.

<br>
<p>The survey's participants ranged in age from 11 to 17, with the majority (70%)
  falling in that age range. With 16.7% of the total responses, respondents between
  the ages of 18 and 24 made up the second-largest group. The remaining respondents,
  who made up 3.3% to 6.7% of the total, were distributed throughout the age brackets
  of 25-34, 45-54, and 55-64. This age distribution indicates that a younger generation,
  particularly those who are in their teenage years, responded eagerly to the survey.</p>

<br>
<p>According to the survey, friends of the streamers make up 56.7% of the respondents,
  while classmates make up 26.7%. The proportion of responders who described themselves
  as the streamers' parents or guardians was 6.7%. Just 3.3% of respondents identify as
  brothers or sisters of streamers, and the same number falls under the category of relatives.
  Another 3.3% of replies come from the social media community. These results point to a
  considerable role played by the streamers' friends and classmates in the study's data,
  which may have an impact on the interpretation of the finding.</p>

<br>
<p>According to the survey, 56.7% of respondents feel they can use streaming information right away,
  while 36.7% think they can use it during the next two to six months. Yet, just 6.7% of the respondents
  believe they will be able to use the knowledge after 7 to 12 months. It's interesting that none of the
  respondents said they would never be able to exploit the data collected by the streamers. These results
  imply that the respondents considered the study's stream of data to be meaningful and pertinent to their
  present or future requirements. No respondents indicated that the data will never be beneficial, indicating
  that the study's conclusions have real-world implications, making it a useful resource for those interested in
  the subject matter.</p>

<br>
<p>90% of the respondents, or the study's sample, responded "Yes" when asked if
  they would like to learn more about the subject. This significant percentage shows
  that the respondents are really interested in the topic and want to learn more about it.
  Just 10% of those surveyed said "No" when asked if they would like to learn more about the
  subject. However, it is important to keep in mind that even this tiny fraction may have a variety
  of excuses for not wanting to learn more, such as having enough background knowledge or a lack of
  interest in the subject. Overall, these findings emphasize the significance of offering more resources
  and knowledge on the subject to those interested, as the vast majority of respondents expressed a desire
  to learn more.</p>

<p>The majority of respondents, or 63.3%, rated the streamers' ability to engage the
  audience about the topic as "Excellent," while 36.7% rated it as "Good," and none of
  the respondents gave a rating of "Fair" or "Poor." These results suggest that the streamers
  have been successful in grabbing the audience's attention and effectively communicating the
  subject matter in an engaging manner. Due to their knowledge, expertise, and communication abilities,
  the streamers' high ratio of "Good" ratings suggests that they are exceptionally skilled at engrossing
  their audience in the subject matter.  These studies emphasize the significance of excellent engagement
  and communication abilities in streaming, which could result in better audience engagement and satisfaction.</p>

<br>
<p>According to the study, a sizable majority of the respondents, accounting for 76.7%, rated the
  stream's content design as "Excellent," along with 20% who gave it a "Good" rating, 3.3% who gave it
  a "Fair," and none who gave it a "Poor" rating. These results indicate that the respondents were
  extremely happy with the stream's overall content design. The high proportion of "Good" ratings
  shows that the information was well-written, aesthetically pleasing, and informative, meeting or
  exceeding the audience's expectations. Although these areas are probably minor, the low percentage
  of "Fair" ratings suggests that there may be room for improvement in the content design. Overall,
  these results show the importance of creating visually appealing and informative content to engage
  and satisfy the audience, as it can significantly impact the audience's perception and overall
  satisfaction with the stream.</p>

<br>
<p>The analysis revealed that none of the respondents rated the time length or duration of the stream as
  "Poor" and that 56.7% of the respondents rated it as "Excellent," along with 26.7% who said it was "Good"
  and 16.7% who said it was "Fair" These results indicate that the majority of the respondents were satisfied
  with the time length or duration of the stream. The majority of "Good" ratings suggest that the stream's length
  and duration were acceptable and maintained viewer interest throughout the session. According to the relatively
  small number of "Fair" ratings, some respondents might have thought the broadcast was either too short or too long.
   Overall, these data emphasize the significance of finding a balance between the duration and time length of the
   stream and the audience's attention span, to ensure that the audience remains engaged and satisfied. </p>

<p>The majority of the respondents, or 73.3%, gave the platform venue for the stream a "Excellent"
  rating, along with 23.3% giving it a "Good" rating, only 3.3% giving it a "Fair" rating, and an interestingly,
  none of the respondents giving it a "Poor" rating. These results indicate that the majority of the respondents
  were very happy with the platform venue for the stream. The large number of "Good" evaluations suggests that the
  platform venue offered an easy-to-use, convenient, and seamless experience for the audience. The fact that so few
  respondents gave the platform venue "Fair" ratings shows that some may have encountered small inconveniences or
  difficulties, while these problems did not materially affect their level of pleasure as a whole. To enhance audience

<br>
<p>Figure 12 shows that the majority of respondents assessed the correctness of the

  These results show that the respondents found the content of the stream to be highly accurate

  aspects of the stream, such as the engagement of the streamers and the content. Moreover, 40%
  of the respondents rated the accuracy of the stream as "Very Good" while only 10% rated it as
  "Good" It should be noted that none of the respondents rated the accuracy of the stream as "Fair"
  or "Poor" The streamers' high proportion of "Great" and "Very Good" scores suggests they did an
  excellent job of presenting accurate and relevant information on the topic, which likely contributed
  to the high level of satisfaction reported by the respondents. Overall, these findings underscore
